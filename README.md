## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed (the application and database are fully containerized and can be used with Docker)
- For local usage: PostgreSQL (or your choice of database) set up, Node.js and yarn installed
- For the application running as expected, database must be seeded, please follow steps accordingly.

###Â Steps

1. Set up environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following (There is a template file .env.template):

- DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?schema=public"
- SECRET_KEY="your_jwt_secret"

2. Production Environment With Migrations And Seeds, Run the following command:

```sh
START_MODE=migrate docker-compose up
```

- This command starts a PostgreSQL database container, migrates and seeds the database, then starts the application.

3. Production Environment, If Database migration and seed is completed already, you can run the following command:

```sh
START_MODE=prod docker-compose up
```

- This command starts a PostgresSQL database container, then starts the application

4. Development Environment, Run the following command for Development mode, all the changes in src folder will restart the application automatically.

```sh
docker-compose up
```

- This command starts a PostgresSQL database container (without migration and seed), then starts the application.

5. For Local Development, Run following commands:

- Database should be up on and running

- For Database Migration:

```sh
yarn migrate
```

- For Database seed:

```sh
yarn seed
```

- For Application running in development mode:

```sh
yarn start:dev
```
